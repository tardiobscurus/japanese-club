## Breif-explenation
After learning the complex concepts of HTML, CSS and JS; I've created a small mock-up of a language club in my high school. Learning the intermediate-beginner concepts such as CSS3 `animations` and JS `window` object and DOM library to interact with the web page. This was maintained between my freshman year through out my sophomore year.

## What I have learned
* Intermediate-beginner CSS3 and JS concepts
* Deep understanding of web UI and UX
